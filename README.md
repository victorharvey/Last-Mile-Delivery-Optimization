## Optimizing Last Mile Delivery Route 
*Organizing routes to deliver parcels with a minimum number of drivers using python*

How do you optimise your route for last mile delivery?

Walmart and Amazon are in a race to get your parcel to you fast.

One day shipping, a luxury 5 years ago, is a standard in online shopping. 

Behind this modern day standard is a frenzy to keep costs down.

Last mile delivery, from distribution centre to a customer, is the most expensive part of a retailerâ€™s supply chain.

In a nutshell, there are no cost savings from economies of scale of moving pallets on a vessel.

Costs typically include:
fuel (59%)
address location (39%), 
labor (36%) 
first delivery failure (34%) - it costs money to come back and redeliver 

Managers at distribution centres organize your routes to deliver parcels with a minimum number of drivers.

Drivers take parcels from fulfilment centres to deliver them to final customers. 

Here amazon and calmat have different strategies.
- Amazon has and is building vast numbers of distribution centres 
- Walmart is using its existing network of retail stores as fulfilment centres.

The fulfilment centres are a key elements in the logistics network of the retailers. 

They provide a large geographical coverage for last-mile delivery.

They have a competitive advantage of:
Offering the best service level
Reducing delivery lead time

I prepared a code to show a solution to optimize the last-mile delivery from these centres.

Based on:
- Reducing costs
- Uniform distribution of workload

Scenario:
You are a manager in a local fulfilment centre:
- 4 drivers in your team
- 15 parcel capacity per vehicle
- 16 destinations to cover in the neighbourhood 
- 1 route per driver
- Demand at each location [0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 4, 8, 8, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 4, 8, 8]

Objective
- Deliver all parcels with a minimum number of drivers
- Optimise the routing to minimise the distance covered per route

Results
- Route for driver
- Parcel per location
- Distance travelled
- Number of parcels delivered

What is interesting is that this form of route optimization by AI can be beaten by a manual system.

Amazon in China was able to achieve better route optimization without AI but through using driverâ€™s local knowledge.
